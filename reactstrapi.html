      <h3>Creating React frontend with Strapi backend</h3>
      <div class="main">
        <body class="blogbody">
          <p>
            I will be explaining at a high level how to initialize a React
            frontend based project with a Strapi backend (with optional cloud
            PostgreSQL via neon.tech and Cloudinary for image hosting). You may
            want to achieve something similar to this if you want to build a
            site for a client and allow them to add their own content via
            Strapi.
          </p>
          <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">React frontend</h4>
          <p>
            Initialize a create-react-app project after CDing to a folder of
            your choice:
          </p>
          <code>npx create-react-app my-app</code>
          <p>cd into that new project and run the React server locally:</p>
          <code>
            cd my-app
            <br />
            npm start
          </code>
          <br />
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">
            Notes on deploying React to Cloudflare:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Domain can be registered on Cloudflare</li>
            <li>
              Build command:
              <code>npm run build</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are using a monorepo, ensure root directory is set to
              directory of your react app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don’t be afraid if your project doesn’t deploy first try.
              Cloudflare seems to be integrated with something strict that your
              local project may not catch (e.g. failing build due to == instead
              of === somewhere in your project)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Strapi backend:</h4>
          <p>
            Initialize a Strapi project after CDing to a folder of your choice:
          </p>
          <code>
            npx create-strapi-app@latest my-strapi-project --quickstart
          </code>
          <br />
          <p>Then, create admin account and get started in Strapi.</p>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Notes on Strapi</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Default 1337 port on localhost can be changed in .env file under
              PORT. Run
              <code>npm run build</code>
              then
              <code>npm run develop</code>
              afterwards to refresh the server.

              Strapi Crash Course by Net Ninja is good info for setting up
              Strapi in terms of permissions and calling the Strapi API via
              GraphQL. Check comments for Strapi 4 queries and code.

          <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Deploying Strapi to Render</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I recommend doing this sooner rather than later. If you’re using
              the free version of Render, then SQLite isn’t going to cut it due
              to Strapi utilizing that on the backend by default, and Render
              essentially killing SQLite and anything else on disk after some
              inactivity (if you pay for any tier on Render the site will remain
              up and not have to cold start and you can use SQLite just fine).
            </li>
            <li>
              This is about as straightforward as deploying a Javascript site to
              Cloudflare.
            </li>
            <li style="text-decoration: underline">
              If using free tier of Render, you will have to deploy databases to
              something cloud based/persistent instead.

              to set up Cloudinary with Strapi. Essentially images all likely
              need to be hosted on an image hosting service rather than directly
              on Render due to bandwidth and usage requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Image sizing when uploading to Cloudinary can be defined in
              plugins.js in your Strapi folder. Here is mine:
              <pre><code>module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
                upload: {
                  config: {
                    provider: "cloudinary",
                    providerOptions: {
                      cloud_name: env("CLOUDINARY_NAME"),
                      api_key: env("CLOUDINARY_KEY"),
                      api_secret: env("CLOUDINARY_SECRET"),
                    },
                    actionOptions: {
                      upload: {},
                      uploadStream: {},
                      delete: {},
                    },
                  },
                  images: {
                    formats: {
                      small: { width: 500, height: 500 },
                      medium: { width: 1000, height: 1000 },
                    },
                  },
                },
              });
              </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              I have run into issues with Cloudinary not uploading all of my
              defined image formats. This can break code if you have statically
              defined specific sizes for an img element. Be sure to add some
              fail safes for rendering different image sizes if one may not
              exist at some point in time if users will be uploading images to
              Strapi post deployment.
